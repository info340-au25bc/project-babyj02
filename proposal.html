      <p>
        Many people reach for the same outfits because their wardrobe information is scattered and hard to act on.
        Photos live in a camera roll, prices live on receipts, and outfit ideas live in memory. None of this is searchable or structured,
        which leads to decision fatigue, underused pieces, and last-minute choices that do not reflect personal style goals.
        I want a web-based space that treats a closet as data I can organize, remix, and plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are related tools such as <a href="https://www.stylebookapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stylebook</a>
        and capsule wardrobe guidance like
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_wardrobe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this overview</a>.
        These are helpful for inspiration, but they often emphasize static galleries or mobile-only experiences.
        My goal is a lightweight, browser-based app focused on quick actions: add items, build an outfit, and plan the week,
        with simple feedback like color balance and cost-per-wear that encourages better use of what I already own.

      <h2 id="app-title">Proposed Application</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>The Capsule</strong> is a single-page React app where I add clothing items, build outfits visually,
        and optionally schedule looks on a weekly view. It is designed to reduce decision time, surface forgotten pieces,
        and make outfit planning feel intentional. All data is user-generated and persists between visits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Core flows: I add items through a form with multiple inputs (name, category, color, price, optional photo).
        I build outfits by selecting items into an outfit canvas and adjusting simple sliders for formality and warmth.
        I save outfits and browse them as cards, and I can assign saved looks to days so repeats are easy to spot.
        The interface provides in-page feedback with loading states and clear errors.
      </p>

      <section class="subsection" aria-labelledby="features-title">
        <h3 id="features-title">Interactive Features</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Add Clothing (Form):</strong> A multi-input form creates items and inserts them into the closet grid without a page reload.</li>
          <li><strong>Outfit Builder:</strong> Select or drag items into an outfit canvas; a live preview shows color swatches and totals. Save to the database.</li>
          <li><strong>Planner (Half Feature):</strong> Assign saved outfits to days using drag-drop or a date selector; the weekly view updates immediately.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="subsection" aria-labelledby="data-title">
        <h3 id="data-title">Data and Persistence</h3>
        <p>
          I will use user content only. No external APIs are required.
          The app reads and writes to Firebase Realtime Database, with optional Firebase Storage for photos.
          Sample records:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>items</code>: { name, category, color, price, imgUrl }</li>
          <li><code>outfits</code>: { name, itemIds[], formality, warmth, totalPrice, palette[], createdAt }</li>
          <li><code>planner</code>: { "yyyy-mm-dd": outfitId }</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Client-side routing will include <code>/closet</code>, <code>/builder</code>, and <code>/outfit/:id</code>.
          I will integrate one third-party React component (drag-and-drop or a small chart) to support the core interactions.
          Sign-in can start with anonymous auth and later allow Google sign-in; authentication will support ownership of data
          but will not be counted as a feature by itself.
        </p>

      <section class="subsection" aria-labelledby="users-title">
        <h3 id="users-title">Users and Impact</h3>
        <p>
          The primary audience is students and anyone who wants faster mornings and better use of what they already own.
          The design avoids gendered assumptions, uses semantic HTML and labels, and aims for clear contrast and keyboard access.
          By surfacing rotation and cost-per-wear, the app encourages more sustainable choices without additional purchases.
